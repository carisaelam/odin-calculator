## Odin project final Foundations project - javascript calculator

This repository contains my solution for the JavaScript Calculator project as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. The goal was to create an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, capable of performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Features include functions for math operators, expression evaluation, a basic HTML interface with digit and operator buttons, display functionality for input and results, and error handling for division by zero. Technologies used include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to use the calculator, where you can click on buttons to perform calculations and view results.
